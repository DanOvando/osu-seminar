Bayesian methods...

- Provide **posterior probability distributions** for parameters, informed by **priors** 
  
  - "What was the probability that the protected area increased biomass by more than 10%"
  
- Give us a framework for incorporating **prior knowledge**
  
- Suited to **complex structures**

# How Many Fish Are There?

Two general options

  1. Conduct fishery-independent surveys
    - Research trawls, acoustics, visual surveys, etc.
    - Accurate (hopefully) but expensive
    
  2. Depend on data from the fishery
    - Fisheries captures
    - Catch-per-unit-effort
    - Cheaper but often biased


---

# Stock Assessments


Ideally, stock assessments fit a **population dynamics** model
    
  - Births
  - Deaths
  - Growth


using  fishery **dependent** and **independent** data

These models estimate **stock status** relative to **reference points**
  - Unfished biomass
  - Biomass that would maximize long-term catch
  - Sustainability of fishing effort

---

# A Tale of Two Fisheries

Stock assessments provide best estimates of the state of fisheries providing <br> ~50% of the world's catch.

# [`sraplus`](https://danovando.github.io/sraplus/)

Core tool of our research: `sraplus`

Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model with process error


$$B_{t + 1} = \left(B_{t} + B_{t}\frac{r}{m - 1}\left(1 - \left(\frac{B_t}{K}\right)^{m- 1}\right) - c_t\right)p_t$$
$$log(p_t) \sim {N}\left(-\sigma_{proc}^2/2,\sigma_{proc}\right)$$

Can... 
  - Run as a catch-only model
  - Incorporate subjective or empirical priors on stock status
  - Fit to abundance index if available

# Moving Beyond Catch-Only

- We can't **infer** stock status based on catch alone
  - We can predict some...

- There's a lot of data between "catch-only" and "full integrated stock assessment"
  - Effort reconstructions
  - Strength of fisheries management
  - Intensity of trawling
  
  Using `sraplus`, we tested the ability of different combinations of **broadly available** data to say something useful about the status of fisheries

Logic is simple: places trawled more often might have higher fishing mortality

## Effects of Protected Areas

---


# Protected Areas

Ecosystem-based management increasingly asked to meet needs of environment and society. 

Protected areas a big part of this
  - Protect 30% of land and water in the coming decade.
  - Up from single digits in global seas now

Social-ecological systems are highly complex
  - Spatial-temporal dynamics
  - Species interactions
  - Human behavior
  
Makes *predicting* and *assessing* the performance of protected areas harder than you might think.

---

# Leaving the Walled Garden

.pull-left[

- Early protected areas focused on providing refuge from the outside world

- Protection has wider impacts
  - "spillover" of adult or larval organisms
  - Displacement of human activities 

- This spillover both allows MPAs to provide wider benefits, but also poses major challenges.

# An Optimistic Skeptic

### The skeptic... 

Someday I hope for a clear answer...

--

  - But it hasn't happened yet. 
  
**Uncertainty and complexity are the norm**

--

### The optimism...

- There are lessons in null-results

- Slow progress towards better understanding and better outcomes

**Science can help us navigate uncertainty and complexity**


???

What do I mean by an optimistic skeptic? Social-ecological systems are complicated. This both complicates our ability to clearly understand what is happening in them, and to identify simple solutions to complex problems. Hence, "skeptic": my prior is that uncertainty and complexity are the norm. Optimist though: I believe that science can help us navigate this uncertainty and complexity in a productive way, to help us move slowly towards better understanding and better outcomes.

# How many fish can we catch?

Suppose we conduct a survey and find that there are 100,000 fish in the population...

--
  
  - Does this represent a large fraction of a small but unfished population?
  
  - A small fraction of a historically massive population?
  
--

Which is right has major implications for management. 

To answer this, we use a class of models broadly called *stock assessments*
